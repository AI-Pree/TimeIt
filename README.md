# TimeIt
Performance profiler for applicaitons

- Using kprobes for dynamic tracing
- Statistics for kernel functions
- Statistics for kernel events


## Goals for Version 1.0
- capturing the time of the applications functions and visualising it in graph
- displaying it in web visualiation form and let user interact with it 
- remote profiling of RPC (extend)
- provide asymptotic time and space complexity of the running subroutines or whole application. 
- Check memory leaks (extend)
- Runtime profiler
- showing a graph on cpu usage, ram usage and uptime
- Algorithm, sampling, instrumental and concurrency profiling
- Live sharing of profiling process with other users
- visualising the graph relationship between the functions of the application
