# TimeIt
Performance profiler for applicaitons


## TO DO
- [ ] Monitoring,  debugging and performance analysis for pthread
- [ ] Using kprobes for dynamic tracing
- [ ] Statistics for kernel functions
- [ ] Statistics for kernel events



## Goals for Version 1.0
- capturing the time of the applications functions and visualising it in graph
- remote profiling of RPC (extend)
- provide asymptotic time and space complexity of the running subroutines or whole application. 
- Check memory leaks (extend)
- Runtime profiler
- Algorithm, sampling, instrumental and concurrency profiling
- visualising the graph relationship between the functions of the application
